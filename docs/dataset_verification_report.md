## ⚠️ IDENTIFIED DISCREPANCIES:

### 1. Money Guy Channel Status
**Issue:** Money Guy appears in CSV (13 videos) but not in main JSON data

**Explanation:** This is expected based on recent data cleanup operations:
- Money Guy was identified as incomplete during extraction (only 13/40 videos)
- The `prepare_money_guy_restart.py` script removed it from JSON for fresh restart
- CSV retains the partial data for reference until full re-extraction

**Impact:** Low - This is part of planned data management

### 2. Video Count Difference
**Issue:** CSV has 573 videos vs JSON has 560 videos

**Explanation:** 13-video difference corresponds exactly to Money Guy partial data
- JSON: 14 complete channels × 40 videos = 560 videos ✅
- CSV: 14 complete channels × 40 + 1 incomplete channel × 13 = 573 videos ✅

## 🎯 DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
