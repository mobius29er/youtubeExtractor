He is best friends with Bob and they host the show together. \n\nJunior Asparagus can be described as curious, courteous and, well, green. He is young and kind, though he can be impatient and sometimes do things wrong, like when he wanted to end the show early so he can have his mother's cookies. He always assumes his way is right, though ultimately he learns later that he has taken advice from elders. \n\nArchibald Asparagus is usually depicted as snooty, intolerable of nonsense, funny, or royal. He often plays as kings, geniuses, and authority figures. As of VeggieTales in the House, he has also become mayor of the town. He apparently always makes the French Peas, Jean Claude and Phillipe, clean up garbage in the park, but never helps.",

He is best friends with Bob and they host the show together. \n\nJunior Asparagus can be described as curious, courteous and, well, green. He is young and kind, though he can be impatient and sometimes do things wrong, like when he wanted to end the show early so he can have his mother's cookies. He always assumes his way is right, though ultimately he learns later that he has taken advice from elders. \n\nArchibald Asparagus is usually depicted as snooty, intolerable of nonsense, funny, or royal. He often plays as kings, geniuses, and authority figures. As of VeggieTales in the House, he has also become mayor of the town. He apparently always makes the French Peas, Jean Claude and Phillipe, clean up garbage in the park, but never helps.",

He is best friends with Bob and they host the show together. \n\nJunior Asparagus can be described as curious, courteous and, well, green. He is young and kind, though he can be impatient and sometimes do things wrong, like when he wanted to end the show early so he can have his mother's cookies. He always assumes his way is right, though ultimately he learns later that he has taken advice from elders. \n\nArchibald Asparagus is usually depicted as snooty, intolerable of nonsense, funny, or royal. He often plays as kings, geniuses, and authority figures. As of VeggieTales in the House, he has also become mayor of the town. He apparently always makes the French Peas, Jean Claude and Phillipe, clean up garbage in the park, but never helps. \n\n#veggietales",

He is best friends with Bob and they host the show together. \n\nJunior Asparagus can be described as curious, courteous and, well, green. He is young and kind, though he can be impatient and sometimes do things wrong, like when he wanted to end the show early so he can have his mother's cookies. He always assumes his way is right, though ultimately he learns later that he has taken advice from elders. \n\nArchibald Asparagus is usually depicted as snooty, intolerable of nonsense, funny, or royal. He often plays as kings, geniuses, and authority figures. As of VeggieTales in the House, he has also become mayor of the town. He apparently always makes the French Peas, Jean Claude and Phillipe, clean up garbage in the park, but never helps.",

He is best friends with Bob and they host the show together. \n\nJunior Asparagus can be described as curious, courteous and, well, green. He is young and kind, though he can be impatient and sometimes do things wrong, like when he wanted to end the show early so he can have his mother's cookies. He always assumes his way is right, though ultimately he learns later that he has taken advice from elders. \n\nArchibald Asparagus is usually depicted as snooty, intolerable of nonsense, funny, or royal. He often plays as kings, geniuses, and authority figures. As of VeggieTales in the House, he has also become mayor of the town. He apparently always makes the French Peas, Jean Claude and Phillipe, clean up garbage in the park, but never helps. \n\n#veggietales",
