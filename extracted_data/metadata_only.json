He is best friends with Bob and they host the show together. \n\nJunior Asparagus can be described as curious, courteous and, well, green. He is young and kind, though he can be impatient and sometimes do things wrong, like when he wanted to end the show early so he can have his mother's cookies. He always assumes his way is right, though ultimately he learns later that he has taken advice from elders. \n\nArchibald Asparagus is usually depicted as snooty, intolerable of nonsense, funny, or royal. He often plays as kings, geniuses, and authority figures. As of VeggieTales in the House, he has also become mayor of the town. He apparently always makes the French Peas, Jean Claude and Phillipe, clean up garbage in the park, but never helps.",

He is best friends with Bob and they host the show together. \n\nJunior Asparagus can be described as curious, courteous and, well, green. He is young and kind, though he can be impatient and sometimes do things wrong, like when he wanted to end the show early so he can have his mother's cookies. He always assumes his way is right, though ultimately he learns later that he has taken advice from elders. \n\nArchibald Asparagus is usually depicted as snooty, intolerable of nonsense, funny, or royal. He often plays as kings, geniuses, and authority figures. As of VeggieTales in the House, he has also become mayor of the town. He apparently always makes the French Peas, Jean Claude and Phillipe, clean up garbage in the park, but never helps. \n\n#veggietales",

This silly story is perfect for teaching toddlers important first words like yes, no, more, and silly.\n\nThis video is AAC-friendly ‚Äî meaning it includes simple modeling of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC), or ‚Äútalking tablets with buttons.‚Äù Research shows that when adults model just a few words during storytime or daily routines, children learn language faster ‚Äî and AAC never stops kids from learning to talk.\n\nWhether your child uses AAC, is learning first words, or just loves fun books, this read-aloud makes storytime inclusive, accessible, and enjoyable for everyone. Created by a speech therapist to support early learning.",

Love the channel man, keep up the good work and I would not be surprised if one day, you go viral and just get big like Jacksepticeye did.  I think I&#39;ll be staying long term buddy. from 6,351 to 1,000,000+.  Once again, love the channel already, keep up the awesome, yet random, vids.",

Now I couldn&#39;t smoke for 40 years to avoid flares bcuz I would just get lung cancer so that does me no good, but evidently that&#39;s the one time cigarettes were beneficial. Also, with alcohol I would HIGHLY recommend you nvr drink that with crohns but while I was on Remicade I had a blast getting plastered LMFAO! We went to this crazy party with cheerleaders one time and since I only knew my one friend and we were surrounded by hot girls I got super drunk :P The feeling of getting drunk is so weird and good, but then a few hrs later u feel super depressed and will think about crazy things. Oh, and I drunk texted my one girl friend and told her my intestines were leaking blood and I was dying and to save me trololololol. The next day i got yelled at cuz she said she was so worried about me :(",

There is a trick to freeze things in time using multiple cameras lined up, I don&#39;t have multiple cameras that are identical in specs, you could make a freaky effect where you have multiple cameras lined up with a slight curve. So the idea is someone walks along them and the person walking stays in the centre of the frame, because you switch between the camera in editing but to the audience it looks like one camera moving, and the freaky part is you play it normally going  cam 1, cam 2, cam 3, cam 4, cam 5, cam 6, cam 7, cam 8 changing the cameras to get the one camera effect then you reverse the footage of the 8th camera so it looks like a cameraman did one cinematic sweep and performed magic to reverse it from the last place he was standing. To sum up the trick I guess It&#39;d be an even crazier version of the normal reversing footage that in the early 2000&#39;s people found so cool accept more mind boggling, please do this as I would love to see this idea come to life, and if you need anymore information on the concept if I haven&#39;t explained it well you can message me, also credit would be appreciated.

I love the fact that you were working so hard for your future and you continue to do so. That is also very inspiring and the thing you offered other youtubers that is very generous. <br><br>Generally i love your videos. They are very relaxing to watch. if you ask me there are a lot of youtubers out there, but you deserve to be the top youtube among them. Cause of the person you are. <br><br>I wish i had that small element of luck to be born in USA, cause life would have been a lot easier for me than where i live now.

              "text": "We need to understand that being at the top of the pyramid of creation means that everything we do trickles down the structure, from top to bottom. When it reaches the bottom, the inanimate level of reality, from which everything grows, it changes it. If we ooze ill-will, it creates negative changes throughout the system, which manifest in increasingly extreme climatic and geological events.<br>In other words, when human relationships go out of balance, everything goes out of balance. When our relations become extreme, everything becomes extreme; when we become violent, everything becomes violent. Each summer, the ramifications of the linkage between our relations and our world become more extreme, until we acknowledge that everything that exists, exists in a connected, hierarchical system and that whoever is at the top determines the state of the rest of the system.<br>It is not as if previously, we were better people than we are today. It is simply that there were fewer people, and therefore fewer elements that exude ill will.<br>Also, relationships between people in the past were less toxic than they are today. While there are fewer wars today than ever, the levels of suspicion and alienation between people are skyrocketing, to the point where people can no longer trust their own family members. As a result, wars between countries are rarer than ever, but divorce rates, domestic violence, and violence in the community, are at an all-time high.<br>Even the internet, which we invented purportedly in order to connect people, is being used to abuse, deceive, and exploit people. The world-wide-web proves that everything we create, we use against others. When there is such a negative element in a system, and that element is at the top of the system, how can the entire system not go awry?<br>Therefore, if we want the weather to cool, the sea-level to drop, and the storms to subside, we must cool the fire and calm the storms between us. Mutual concern, mutual responsibility, or at least the knowledge that we are dependent on each other, are necessary in order to restore balance in our world at all levels, from the ground we walk on to the hatred in our hearts.",
