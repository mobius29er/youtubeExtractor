I found a mentor who made it to phase 3 and was injured, but he met me everyday at 5am to teach me to do a proper pushup, get my swim times right, and make sure I was safe in the water.  Eventually, we did this routine at least once per week, and made it harder by stopping at the bottom to tie knots, play rock-paper scissors, or add a frontflip to each dive in drownproofing.  The hardest thing in the pool for me was the 50 yards underwater, but I got close to 75 by the time I started talking to recruiters.  For several painful reasons, I was advised (not by my mentor) that my only shot was to lie at MEPS, but I couldn&#39;t morally swallow that.  I really miss this though.  The only part of this specific routine that I didn&#39;t find fun was the mask retrieval, but it&#39;s fun and nostalgic now.",

    "text": "I&#39;m from Singapore and we have mandatory national service when boys reach 18yo. I and 100 other people of my age were selected to be part of a combat diver group. The first day our instructors told us we were here due to our genetics and that we should thank our parents. Two weeks in and we were down to 96 people (heat stroke, slip disk, dislocated shoulder). <br><br>The start of the third week was our drown proofing test , I remember this well cause I failed it twice. The first time the rope around my legs came loose and I failed and had to redo. The second time I failed was cause I got exhausted front flipping , the instructor keep saying my front flip was not perfectly straight and I have to redo, the thing is you can keep trying in the water as long as you don&#39;t get out, so I tried flipping for like 20mins before I got exhausted and gave up. (I teared up a lil in silence , can&#39;t cry in the army) the part of the pool we did the bobing and flipping and mask retrieving was at the 4m mark, imagining exhaling all your air in your lungs to so you can sink to be able to flip , then inhale water as you do it , come up and have the instructor tell you ,&quot; your flip is wrong&quot; then you spend your time dead man floating to catch your breath to do it again and again for 20mins. the best part was I didn&#39;t even know how to front flip underwater , the day of our test they just expect us to do it , no lessons before hand btw, so I ask those whom have cleared it how to do it and tried again. Got through with my third try but wasn&#39;t happy being one of the last. <br><br>Now I have cleared my training, hellweek included with 47 others and now I&#39;m waiting to finish my two years and go back to school.",

A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.<br><br>Strategy<br><br>His fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent&#39;s hand.<br><br>The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender&#39;s part, though be wary of spells.<br><br>A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter&#39;s splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.<br><br>The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent&#39;s go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.<br><br>However, this strategy isn&#39;t very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.<br><br>Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.<br><br>It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King&#39;s Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.<br><br>In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent&#39;s card rotation.<br><br>Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider&#39;s health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.<br><br>When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.<br><br>Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent&#39;s side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.<br><br>Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent&#39;s side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.<br><br>If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.<br><br>For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.<br><br>For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.<br><br>They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider‚Äôs landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.<br><br>The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.<br><br>A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player&#39;s King&#39;s Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King&#39;s Tower&#39;s health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted<br><br>A very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.<br><br>This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.<br><br>The Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.<br><br>A Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.<br><br>Pairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings. Additionally, they are easy to separate, due to the disparity in move speeds. Alternatively, the Hog Rider and the Balloon can be played in different lanes to spread the opponent&#39;s defenses thin. However, a building or Tornado can bring them back together for an easier defense.<br><br>The Hog Rider can be paired with the Lumberjack as both a swarm bait and damage combo. It is a very fast combo with an extremely high damage output potential, so the enemy will likely try to counter it with a swarm. If this happens, use a spell like Arrows to render the opponent defenseless. If they manage to defeat the Lumberjack, the dropped Rage will make the Hog Rider even more dangerous than it normally is.<br><br>A fast and deadly combination is the Hog Rider and Mini P.E.K.K.A. combo. Both units are fast but the Mini P.E.K.K.A. does much more damage and does not attack only buildings so the Mini P.E.K.K.A. can deal with troops like the Executioner and Musketeer. However, this combo can be defeated with swarms like Skeleton Army, which will defeat both of them since neither of them can deal area damage. They are also unable to target air troops, so the Minion Horde can stop this easily.<br><br>A risky play is to deploy the Hog Rider at the bridge as soon as the match starts. If the opponent does not react fast enough, the Hog Rider will deal a significant amount of damage to the Princess Tower. This can also allow the player to quickly scout the opponent&#39;s deck if they happen to react to him fast enough",

    "text": "I actually had the opportunity to run this course in 2013 (albeit the obstacles have changed since then). I was 35 at the time and in fairly average, maybe slightly better than average shape.  A BUDs student, an Ensign who was absolute hulk of a guy and in the shape of a straight up V from the waist up, came out and talked to us about how it&#39;s usually the smaller guys who do well in BUDs, and the bigger guys usually fail.  He demonstrated the course in about 5 minutes flat.  Came across the finish line perfectly fine, not even out of breath or looking tired.  I thought to myself okay, this guy is a little younger, and in a little better shape than me (I was lying to myself), if he can do it in 5, I&#39;ll give myself 10.  A HALF HOUR LATER I literally crawled across the finish line on my hands and knees, fell over on my side and just laid there contemplating if death was really that bad for the next 15 minutes, while trying half heartedly to convince the other half dead people I was fine.  One of the greatest experiences of my life, but you could not pay me enough to ever do it again!",

    "text": "I was in 160th SOAR in US Army, and my mos was 18D (Special Forces Medical Sergeant). I began as a Combat Medic, and after my first tour to Kuwait-Iraq (‚Äò91-92), I had completed an Associate Degree in Nursing, an EMT Certification (civilian), and considerable combat skills. So, from E-3 to E-5, then E-6 after our 42 week training regime.  It was F-ing HARD IN ALL WAYS! Classes included ‚ÄúBasic Field Surgical Skills,‚Äù ‚ÄúACLS,‚Äù ‚ÄúIV Therapy,‚Äù and a TON of more to add.  There were also ‚Äúmock‚Äù clinicals, then you were placed in a unit similar to where you would remain. SOAR picked me. They have LOW turnover, so if one member retires, they go out and look for the best possible person (Thank you, Major Gallagher!). I‚Äôm SOAR, it‚Äôs infamous that we flew the choppers who transported SEAL Team Six in the Bin Laden kill.  That is where SOAR requires a diverse group, pilots, medics, snipers, demo, on and on.  As for training, the medical half was difficult, but I think only because of the nature of any Army training- they take it up a notch by adding military procedure too.  The second half involves combat and flight.  The key word was SURPRISE!  I‚Äôll do one example and get going.  About 4-5 months in, all trainees were on a Chinook and WE became the emergency!!!  We had (fictitiously) been struck at night by a second chopper, and both were going down.  I saw a LARGE explosion below us, identified as other chopper with crew members alive.  We did a bumpy SMOKY landing in a forest, lit up the area, and it played out until we each performed the task assigned them by Captain, and then we got a green flag and were secluded until all 12 of us had passed.  That happened a LOT!  But I‚Äôm grateful now, because within months, it WAS REAL, the emergency was either going to a red zone where combat injury was more likely or responding to a specific emergency- usually while combat was ongoing.  So SEAL, SOAR, GREEN BERET, RANGER, DELTA and others, we ALL had a good training platform, and it was just the first step on a bumpy hike uphill.  Afterwards, do it again in Evaluating the mission successes and failures. Revise. Improve.  Stay Frosty, My Bros and Sis, G.Lock, US Army (Ret.).",

Is this true, and what are the chances of getting accepted?<br><br>Thank you for so your insightful videos, I believe I will now share these with him.

That opportunity doesn&#39;t happen everyday and that chance is rare for sure!!! Whatever it cost you it was worth it no doubt. I know it is a sad day for you deciding to cancel the fitness Friday&#39;s. I have seen how important this is to you. All of you fitness advice has always been helpful for me. I am looking forward to your 10 week guide 100%!!! Just a food food for thought side note have you thought about creating a seperate youtube channel just for your Austin Alexander Fitness Friday&#39;s?? You would prob get a few thousand subscribers to that for sure if you were looking at 80/20% viewers normally. I really liked the kitchen fridge scene with you and Sarah too by the way!! It made me smile and laugh big time when you were talking about your stuff in the fridge and Sarah was giving you a hard time when she was saying &quot;Your welcome&quot; for buying/getting what you needed haha. That just shows she truely loves you bro. I wish I was lucky enough to have a girl that cared about me like she cares about you.",

My wife actually cheated on, gaslighted, left me, and is trying to take everything ive worked for while running my name down the drain. Oh and to top of all that some of the people closest to me helped her hide it all. Like you I met her while I was in the military and we got married after I got out. She faked illnesses and said she couldnt work. So i saved and worked 60 to 90hrs a week so we could buy a house and have a 6 month emergency fund and prepare to have kids and lay the groundwork to raise them in better circumstances than we grew up in. But i guess that wasnt enough. Really sucks and to make matters worse I was a little b!tch about it ngl. So in stereotypical guy form I got back in shape and got ripped again (didnt buy a sports car though lol) and recently started running again (even my dog joins me). Its tough though Ive always liked lifting but hated running. Seeing you push through that marathon and admit to the heartache youve been dealing with and the extent of how much its affected you mentally yet you keep pushing is pretty damn motivating ngl. So thanks man and keep up the great work!",

I trained, but I&#39;m not a runner due to my frame size and injuries, but I finished...and that&#39;s the only goal anyone should have for their first marathon. My wife thought I was nuts, because I got up and ran in the tremendous downpours we had in TN, and the wall I hit at mile 18 (a few weeks before the event) when it was 100F+ with 80%+ humidity. I called her then to come get me, but I felt like a failure because I only had to do two more miles back to the house. I lived through that and ran my fastest miles off and on (sub 7m) the week after during the final 26m training run. You are a commendable person; thank you. I have fallen out of shape, but slowly going back at it, and I still have my tri bike, and so wanting to do a triathlon.

    "text": "Amazing Austen . Very inspiring. It touched me at the end , when you passed Mile 20 and gave your perspective on life and the battles you‚Äôve overcome in life and relationships , it choked me up. My friends and family are some of the most amazing human beings I‚Äôve ever known but they all fight some sort of demons and depression as most normal people do throughout their lives . They have lost friends and family due to suicide, some even parents of children, some were children, some due to Military PTSD. I‚Äôve even fought off demons and terrible thoughts but have always been able to battle through and do my best to inspire others. We preach family and love and just overall being there for each other. We do our best to motivate others and do everything we can to help others see goals and push them to not just dream but to achieve. Team Pineapple4life is a way of living and is about Ohana and will be a charity someday. My sons and I would love to come out to SoCal one day and to hang or do a challenge with you. They are my bestfriends. My  Bestfriend of 40 years would love to bring his son out as well. Keep doing what you do, it‚Äôs not your job to motivate and inspire others, but you do it well and I thank you.<br><br>FYI: I have a brother in law who has a charity called Winter of the Beards out of Michigan, Created due to a former soldier and friend who committed suicide. They raise money for soldiers and families. <br>I have another friend who has created a company called Warrior staffing who help soldiers transitioning out find work before they even head back into normal life which takes a lot of stress of them and their families. The jobs are normally in Tech aspects of behind the scenes in television.  Congratulations on finishing the marathon!!!",

Firearms training was about the same, we did PT more often in the academy and still had field day inspections and all that stuff. What made it harder was all the academic tests you had to pass. You had about two hours of law a day mixed with scenarios. First guy to leave our class was a combat medic from the 101st. Second guy was a SP the Air Force. Having said that, an Army guy got our top shot award and our class leader was a Marine. The guys that really excelled in our class were guys who came from corrections. My roommate in the academy was a former corrections officer and he was awesome. Those guys do well on scenarios and have a good understanding of report writing and use of force.",

Just my opinion I could be wrong. Also instead of saying you don&#39;t like to save, I think it would have been better to say I like to buy assets and then explain to people who don&#39;t know what assets are. I&#39;m not sure if this made sense but it&#39;s just my opinion. As I&#39;m writing this I see the video was posted 3 years ago, you probably know much more now.",

Background checks brought up his past the recruiter said he didn&#39;t have to put down on enlistment.<br> Instant out,he was devistated. Came home, went to the same recruiter and he denied it all.

I researched each rate and got others opinions on it (I also recommend making a top 10 list of jobs for when you go to MEPS) CTI CTT and CTN were my top 3 but they weren‚Äôt available so I picked AM and I‚Äôm loving it. They told me what would be cool and the parts that would suck. By far the best outcome I could‚Äôve asked for. My recommendation for all of you future enlistees is to find out the jobs you qualify for and research them on your own. Don‚Äôt let your recruiter lie off their a$$ and you wind up hating the next 4-6 years of your life.",

Keep up the good work, nonetheless.<br><br>A key piece of getting around the lies is doing your research.  Some of the dumbest things I heard as an RDC, instructor, etc., was &quot;I hope I don&#39;t have to go out to sea.&quot;  Of my 22 years in, I was underway over 3000 days.  I was in a sea going rate and I knew as FC I would be frequently haze grey and underway.  This was why I chose FC over ET.  I wanted to go to sea.  MA2 here, is not in sea going rate, not really.  On a CG or DDG there&#39;s as many as 40 FCs, but only 1 MA.  Many in the navy will say, &quot;choose your rate, choose fate.&quot;  No matter what the choice is, just as I learned when was 19 years old in Yokosuka, Japan, the navy is what you make it.  If you choose to hate life, you&#39;ll hate life.  If you choose to have fun, you&#39;ll have fun.  Some also say NAVY stands for Never Again Volunteer Yourself.  I said F*** That!  Volunteer for everything.  That&#39;s how you get the coolest experiences.  I will say, however, that I don&#39;t miss standing watch in CIC.  It sucks 99% of the time and really cool only 1% of the time.  I&#39;ll take MA2&#39;s watch any day over a CIC watch, but perhaps his grass just appears greener.",

Kinda sucks when you&#39;re a Chief and they want you back as a first.",

Sure enough I was aviation bound after boot camp. Went to Aviation Electricians Mate A school in Jacksonville Florida and then out to the fleet, VF-11 on USS Forrestal. Three months mess cooking in the Chief&#39;s Mess and then off to the AE Shop. AE Chief asked if I was interested in helping out the ATs, I said sure and then went to the AT Shop. After two months with the ATs I put in a special request chit to change my rating to AT, it came back approved. Two years later I was AT-2 and loving life. U.S. Navy, no regrets!",

    "text": "I attended MCRD San Diego in 1989. Some funny things:<br><br>1. They were making a boot camp movie so film crews followed us around the whole 12 weeks. When you first get off the bus and stand on the yellow footprints you‚Äôre freaking out. Until they put us back on the bus and do it again from another camera angle!<br><br>2. I was 5‚Äô10‚Äù and 120 lbs. I was placed on double rations, so I had to eat twice as much as everyone else, in the same time. <br><br>3. My worst screw up was during the Company Commander‚Äôs inspection. He asked me a question and in my zeal to sound off loud, I accidentally spit in his face. He just chuckled, but the DI didn‚Äôt take it so well. <br><br>4. I don‚Äôt remember gas chamber as too bad. It was way worse out in the fleet. MCAS Cherry Point, where I was stationed, had a chemical trail with barb wire and other obstacles to get through. They once popped a CS grenade right between my legs when I was crawling under the barbed wire. That was so strong that all my exposed skin was burning. I got my mask on, but it still sucked. <br><br>5. During a hump at Camp Pendleton we were resting on the beach. An honest to God unopened Dr. Pepper can washed up not 10 feet from me. I was jonesing so hard for that, but with deuce gear and full pack I couldn‚Äôt move quick and stealthy enough to grab it before a DI saw me. He was not pleased. <br><br>6. During the final few weeks we picked up a new DI, apparently fresh from the DI school. He was marching us to chow one night and got lost. He was pretty exasperated and had the guide call out directions at the intersections to get there. <br><br>7. As boot camp progresses the DI‚Äôs gradually become more chill and more human. We had a short Puerto Rican DI who was hard as nails and constantly scared the crap out of us. He could climb the ropes by using two ropes with just his arms. Towards the end after dinner he marched us someplace quiet, formed a school circle, and took his Smoky Bear cover off. There we found out he was a huge comic book collector and he taught Sunday School at his church. <br><br>8. The night before graduation we had a talent show. Our senior DI found out that I could do a perfect impression of one of our DI‚Äôs and he had me do it, and he put his Smoky Bear on my head. It was pretty awesome and crazy funny.",

I was READY for classroom training after 6 years in the military so I attacked it with a passion. The cool thing about college was it trained my brain to be an engineer. I also made a lot of friends in college as we helped each other make it through to graduation. I‚Äôm thankful for BOTH experiences in my life. Good times. Thanks for the video!",

    "text": "Great vid! I‚Äôll drop this from experience. Everyone goes to college and think it‚Äôs the only way to be successful because that‚Äôs the norm and that‚Äôs what they were told/taught and expected to do. The military really puts you so much ahead of a standard college route if you take advantage of all that is available. 1st of all people think everyone in the military runs around with guns all day, thats 1 job. There are pilots, legal men, Dr‚Äôs, nurses, those who build bombs, disarm bombs, run engineering plants, IT‚Äôs, Electricians and numerous jobs just like the civilian world. Imagine trade school but for all jobs cut out all the electives and paper writing of college and just learning a profession in a few months. 3-4yrs of service in the military pays for whatever college you want! Totally free! You can get multiple degrees if you‚Äôd like. The experience you get from traveling the world, leading other people and dealing with working relationships, and conflict straight from go is incomparable. While college kids are going to class, gaining debt for 4-6 yrs, military individuals are working and making a paycheck twice a month and getting OTJ experience. So after 4yrs, college student has a degree, owes $100,000+, no job experience and looking for a job. After 4 yrs military vet is out of the military, has a security clearance, saved $100,000, has 4 yrs of work experience /certifications, and has been around the world. May probably already have a degree from one of numerous DOD college tuition assistance programs and CLEP programs and if not is set up now to step into a free college experience that the DOD is going to pay for‚Ä¶while still paying them $4-5000 a month (maybe more depending on living location) for their food and rent/mortgage. Or they can pass the college to one of their kids to use later because like mention before they may have already finished a free degree while in service so because of their security clearance, military experience, certifications and on the job training they just land a contractor job making 80-130k..I‚Äôve seen it go each way dozens of times. Not even talking about all the benefits for free medical and housing loans that‚Äôs another story. Young people reading this know there is more than one way to skin a cat! The 3-4 yrs in the military can REALLY set you up for a great life as well with zero debt. I‚Äôm no recruiter but Ive been there just passing on nuggets. Now know the military isn‚Äôt all rainbows all the time just like nothing is but trust me it can set you up!!",

I like that they pay for your college, which is good because I DON&#39;T WANT TO BE IN DEBT, but at the same time.....I rather be in debt if it means I get to have more life experiences. I&#39;ve talked to several people and I&#39;ve been told by them to go to college because I can get started with my career and If I were to join the navy by the time i began college would be 22 yrs of age. I WANT TO SEE THE MILITARY AS AN INVESTMENT but at the same time a gain on life experiences. It would be helpful if anyone can comment their input and help me make a decision :)",

Military would have been soooo much better, go do what your told when your told and all is good. No arguing just a nice world of absolutes. The big bonus would be the comradery.

    "text": "I never thought of college vs military as an either/or proposition.  I joined the Army after high school for several reasons: 1) patriotism, 2) still somewhat immature, 3) it was a path to what I wanted to do as a career (didn&#39;t actually manage that career, but close).  Patriotism - I was raised in Alabama like you and it was just part my culture to want to help defend my country.  Immature - I wanted to be a physicist after high school but didn&#39;t know how I was going to manage that (8 years of college after HS with no income seemed daunting).  Path to my goal - the Army taught me discipline and the importance of taking responsibility for my actions.  The more responsibility I showed in the Army, the more I was given.  While I was still in the Army, they paid for all my tuition and even gave me time off (when Stateside, anyway) when I needed it to work on my degree.  After the Army (7 years in), I had the GI Bill to help pay for college.  While I never did complete my degree in physics, I did get a degree in Math and Computer Engineering and had a satisfying career.  Anyway, all of this was to say that, in my opinion, you don&#39;t have to make a decision between college or the military - you can do both.  As you can probably deduce from this comment, I&#39;ve been out of the Army a long time, but the lessons learned lasted me a lifetime.  I&#39;ve enjoyed your content and hope you keep producing more.",

However, it&#39;s at the top of the vert, basically the highest point on the jet. Some dipshit dropped it from the high point and I was below it. It hit my elbow, which was about 6&quot; from my head at the time. After it hit me, it put a hole in the concrete. Somehow it didn&#39;t break my arm, but the ER couldn&#39;t stop the bleeding. Two torniquets and four hours later, I was somewhat good. My uniform was covered in blood.<br>Worst part about it was it happened at the end of shift on a Friday, and I was going TDY the next week. I told them if it wasn&#39;t broken that I&#39;m good, and I would deal with it because I was not missing that TDY! Haha.",

    "text": "Because I&#39;m a nurse with over 30 years of experience and have had MRSA, your story both horrified and angered me. I have heard of too many people in this exact spot, whether military or not, that ignored the symptoms of an infection due to various reasons. I get it, I was military also and wanted so much to graduate boot camp (Army). I also had problems with pneumonia during boot camp and was scared that I wouldn&#39;t graduate. But back to the reason for my post.<br>MRSA and/or various types of staph infections are no joke. We had people coming back from Afghanistan with MRSA. When they first got to the hospital, they were put into isolation and stayed there until they got cleared and had crazy amounts of IV antibiotics. Some did lose limbs because of it and we nurses tried really hard not to get them to that point. So people really need to look out for staph infections and try to prevent them by going to get things checked out before they get to the point of almost losing a leg (Austen). Really, though, I&#39;m glad you made it out okay. And from your other videos, you really try and take care of yourself and educate people on healthy routines and diets. You&#39;ve come a long way since this video and I commend you for doing them. Take care.",

I was in algebra after day of ignoring severe pain in my right knee - and I go to get up to turn a paper in, and I couldn‚Äôt walk. I automatically burst into tears and rolled my pant leg up and freaked out when I saw how swollen it was. I ended up going to my family doctor and he tried numbing my leg before lancing it but the infection was so deep in my knee, the numbing wouldn‚Äôt work. So I felt every single cut he made and scraping the inside of my knee to get the infection out. The doctor told me he would‚Äôve had to amputate my leg from the knee down if I would‚Äôve waited even one more day to come in. Scary stuff for sure. Oh and he said I probably got it from band camp. I guess I nicked my leg shaving and then going to camp around nasty sweaty kids made me get it is what he told me lol",

A Chief one morning told me I looked like a ghost and I broke down and told him I have been sick for a couple of days. He directed me to Sick call. It turned out I has Rubella German Measles. The doc said it was a allergic reaction from one of my shots I had received.  After a week in the hospital,  I w as s able to return to my Company.  The training instructor told me if I could study all the lessons they had taken that week and pass the test, i would not get set back. So, at night a group of my fellow boots got together and tutored me and i passed. It goes to show you how working together in Bootcamp really paid off BIG TIME for me. I enjoy your videos.

    "text": "It could have been flesh-eating disease. OR, if it got past your lymph nodes it could have turned into sepsis.  You could easily have lost your leg or life.  I met a guy, a fellow civilian, who lost a foot.  Damn, if you&#39;d seen a doctor the next day, when it got red around the area of the pimple you popped, you&#39;d have had maybe 10 days.  This time Navy damn near lost a great sailor, but now many sailors weren&#39;t that lucky.  They need improved procedures/communications so someone in boot camp is not going to fear being put back to the next class for something really minor, like needing antibiotics.<br><br>This isn&#39;t something particular to being in the military, it happens in the civilian world too.  And especially men, especially young men, men hesitate to go to the doctor.  And that happens even up here in Canada where we have universal medicare for all, and the doctors are &quot;free&quot; (taxpayer paid).",
