Absolutely top tier.<br><br>Edit: Seems a lot of people are finding humour in the &quot;normalize&quot; term, we get itüíÄ but the fact that there are also replies with people stating that they&#39;re not comfortable crying proves my point lol. We&#39;re not obligated to share how we&#39;re feeling but trust me, letting go and crying every once in a while can make you feel so much lighter. I think if we try as a collective to be less judgemental of people around us who cry (especially men), you&#39;ll find it easier to comfortably grieve or laugh or reminisce with tears. Watch a video of cute puppies, or soldiers coming home, or a sappy movie every now and then if you find it hard to let it out. Try and find time even if it&#39;s for 5 minutes to scream into a pillow or bawl your eyes outüòÇ, don&#39;t be too hard on yourself, you&#39;re loved. It&#39;s going to be ok. ‚ù§Ô∏è",

    "text": "When I went to prison on my first go around, they have a place called, &quot; the box&quot; which is basically the &quot;hole&quot; or solitaire confinement. It&#39;s horrible little messed up cell. The brick walls, no window, a big intimidating metal door, a metal framed bed bolted to the ground, a metal toilet with a sink on it. One light on the ceiling that stays on all day, all night. I was sent to the box the first time for a fight, that actually never really happened, with someone that I didn&#39;t even know, it&#39;s too long of a story but there I was in the cell next to his in the box and the only way to speak to each other was through a heating vent on the ground that ran through both of our cells. We would talk, because other than writing or reading that was the only thing to do. We talked for hours, for days, then weeks, we got pretty close without even ever seeing each other. <br>The box will do something to weird to your mind. The first few days are probably the worst. Time is slow, the light will give you a headache and you&#39;ll spend a lot of time just walking back and forth but something happens to a lot of people in there after awhile, time starts passing. You forget all about it and it just kinda speeds up without you noticing it, at this point of being in there, what the hell is time anyways? It doesn&#39;t matter. You&#39;ll forget what day it is. Then forget the date all together and sometimes when your up really late talking you&#39;ll go to bed late, or early depending on how long you talked and then there goes your normal sleeping cycle and if it wasn&#39;t for the kind of shit food your getting you wouldn&#39;t know if it was day or night and usually at this point you couldn&#39;t give less of a fuck. When I said that the box does weird shit to your head I meant that it really twists your shit up because before they we&#39;re going to put me back in general population I decided I was just going to refuse. I was going to stay in that little cell for as long as I could or until I paroled and that&#39;s what I did. I spent three years in that box. Obviously my neighbor left and over the next few years many came and left and I enjoyed talking to them, getting to know them, getting close to a human with just conversation knowing that I would most likely never see them again, that was a special feeling. I liked the books I read and I got really good at drawing. Increased my drawing skills up to portrait level using covers of books and the occasional magazine. <br>That cell changed me in more ways to count. Some good things and some not. Sorry for rambling it&#39;s just that this video reminded me of my little cell in the box.",

Some of the experiences shown here are traditionally triggered by psychedelic substances. When the mind has no input stimuli (no sight, sound and other things such as touch), it creates its own visuals based on the sum total of a person&#39;s lifetime experiences. The imagery seen can be metaphorical, with shapes, visuals and 3D &amp; 4D space &quot;representing different meaningful memories&quot;. This explanation is simplistic at best, but basically what is happening here. Well done on completing the challenge. It would be interesting to see your Dad go through the same experience, and see what comes out from his mental library.",

She watched me during the day as I grew up, but eventually she moved away and there were some promises made that weren‚Äôt kept. As a little kid that really hurt me, I felt betrayed by someone I cared about. Because of that we always had a rocky relationship and I worry to this day that the rest of my family might think I didn‚Äôt love her, or that I don‚Äôt miss her. Sometimes I worry the same thing.<br><br>This made me realize that I do. <br><br>Thank you for sharing such a vulnerable moment and giving the viewers the chance to reflect on their own lives.

That&#39;s because the map and battery mileage doesn&#39;t account for the weight of the car, weather or other factors that might reduce the overall mileage. The mileage is just based on the most you could get from the battery if it has 1 driver and the rest of the car is empty with good weather. Also the temperature of the battery also matters as well as the age (the older the battery the less mileage)",

I never fully understood it at the time, but the classes I heard those noises in...there was always at least one computer in the room.

I was stood a few 3 metres way from one of the smaller bells and the full set of 12 were ringing. I had noise cancelling headphones on to protect my ears otherwise I would have suffered significant damage to my hearing. However, the physical trauma to my body was still significant. A church bell is shaped like the human rib cage and has multiple harmonics. This means that my rib cage was resonating in harmony with one of the bells and that was painful.",

Now I don&#39;t want to offend anyone cause I really don&#39;t know that much about autism or the background behind it but what little I do know poses an interesting question.

The bass from the valve sound system makes your chest feel like it&#39;s being crushed. Good times but i now have tinnitus which is a constant ringing or buzzing noise in your ears. So my advice to younger people is be careful when going out to raves or concerts. Don&#39;t stand so close to the speakers and take ear plugs with you incase it gets too loud. Also don&#39;t blast your ears with music through headphones so much. Trust me you don&#39;t want permanent tinnitus so turn it down a bit and take regular breaks to give your ears a rest.",

Let me explain:<br>The bleep or beep test is a multi-stage fitness test in which you must do 20 metre shuttle runs in time with the bleeps until the bleeps get too quick for you. It is a maximal test which means it will take you to your fitness limit. The shuttle runs are done in time to bleep sounds on a pre-recorded audio cassette.",

As somebody that doesn&#39;t plan to specialize in long distance, but does want to make varsity. (time needed in a 5k for varsity for my school is about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=im1oMVUENWQ&amp;t=1080\">18:00</a> or so for the 7th runner). What would you recommend I do during the summer (I did pretty much no running the last 6 weeks before XC began). Edit: I&#39;m a sophomore.<br><br>In case you want to know what I plan on specializing in, I got 42 feet my freshman year in the triple jump (again with no offseason training).",

I was really sad but watching these videos reminds me that even if you‚Äôre behind many people, you can still push yourself to win. It‚Äôs honestly so inspiring how you just kept pushing yourself. If I was behind those two guys I would have surely stayed behind them, but after watching this video I remember that I can do something even when it seems impossible. So thank you @ryantrahan.",

    "text": "This reminds me of Christmas 2022. I realized I had approximately $0 for Christmas gifts for my friends and family so I looked at two things - 1) what do I already have that I can flip into something sellable and 2) what do I already know how to do and do it well? The answer was butter, cream and sugar and making caramels. I literally started with ingredients I already had in the house and used my grandmother&#39;s recipe.<br><br>My first sales went much like yours  - selling small one off batches to earn enough to slowly scale up and buy more ingredients and better wrappers (my first ones were handcut parchment paper because that&#39;s what I had on hand!). I made enough to buy those Christmas gifts and squirrel away some for market and booth fees for the next holiday season. I&#39;ve kept it up and hustled where I could when I could!<br><br>Now, my goal is to get my itty bitty caramel company to the next level by getting into a commercial kitchen by the end of this year and out from my state&#39;s cottage law. This opens up new opportunities for me to sell online, in stores, etc. and continue to grow slowly and steadily.<br><br>It&#39;s tough at times, but I love having something that is mine even if it&#39;s small.

You needed to find 50 Airbnbs across 50 states, that you could drive between in a day, that weren&#39;t booked yet and you had to probably book those for multiple nights to account for hiccups on the trip. Then you needed to account for all of the challenges and how they could affect the trip, plan your filming around it as well, talk through everything with your editing team (every day) and discuss with Haley how even though it is the trip of a lifetime it is VERY involved and hard work. I&#39;m probably missing a bunch of things but all of the work shines through and it is a much appreciated summer series that goes beyond the state of the world and brings everyone some much needed positivity.",

The owner came running out looking terrified shouting, &quot;Are you OK? Are you OK?!&quot; with the most genuine concern. He helped her up and began cleaning up the mess by himself. When he walked away my friends and I just stared in shock at each other. How the hell did that place get such a crap reviews about the owner? When we were done we asked to speak with the owner and he was extremely nice to us. We offered to tip him and his waitress (the one who fell happened to be the one refilling our drinks) and he legit said, &quot;Just give her my tip, she&#39;s had a rough day&quot;. I don&#39;t take reviews seriously at all because I get the feeling that 90% of bad reviews come from trolls and Karens.",

It really felt like a bit when the second we see him, the supposed devil himself, he is offering a child cookies. <br><br>I‚Äôve also never heard of this creator before watching this video, but I think that‚Äôll be changing. I expected to see him just film some regular restaurant madness like a younger Gordon and make money off of videos of owners losing it with the ‚Äûboom‚Äù sound effect added on top of it, but he actually just saw that they were cool and left them five stars. Like a reverse YouTuber, almost.

    "text": "Desenvolvimento:<br>S√≥crates foi um fil√≥sofo ateniense que viveu no s√©culo V a.C. Ele foi um dos primeiros a desafiar as cren√ßas e valores estabelecidos em sua sociedade por meio do m√©todo socr√°tico, que consistia em fazer perguntas para estimular a reflex√£o e levar os indiv√≠duos a descobrirem a verdade por si mesmos. Para S√≥crates, a sabedoria verdadeira vinha do autoconhecimento e da busca pela virtude. Ele acreditava que a vida examinada era a √∫nica que valia a pena ser vivida e que a virtude era o caminho para a felicidade e a realiza√ß√£o pessoal.<br><br>Por sua vez, Plat√£o foi disc√≠pulo de S√≥crates e fundou a Academia de Atenas, uma das primeiras institui√ß√µes de ensino superior do mundo ocidental. Para Plat√£o, a filosofia era a busca pelo conhecimento absoluto e eterno, que estava al√©m do mundo sens√≠vel e mut√°vel. Ele desenvolveu a teoria das ideias, afirmando que o mundo vis√≠vel era apenas uma c√≥pia imperfeita e transit√≥ria das formas ideais, que representavam a verdadeira realidade. Al√©m disso, Plat√£o tamb√©m abordou quest√µes pol√≠ticas em sua obra &quot;A Rep√∫blica&quot;, onde prop√¥s um modelo de governo ideal, baseado na justi√ßa e na harmonia entre as classes sociais.<br><br>Conclus√£o:<br>A influ√™ncia de S√≥crates e Plat√£o na filosofia e no pensamento humano √© ineg√°vel. Suas teorias e m√©todos de questionamento continuam sendo estudados e discutidos at√© os dias atuais. S√≥crates nos ensinou a import√¢ncia do autoconhecimento e da busca pela verdade, enquanto Plat√£o nos fez refletir sobre a exist√™ncia de uma realidade al√©m do mundo sens√≠vel. Al√©m disso, suas ideias sobre moralidade, √©tica e pol√≠tica contribu√≠ram para o desenvolvimento de conceitos fundamentais na filosofia ocidental. A vida e as obras desses dois fil√≥sofos s√£o um legado valioso que nos desafia a pensar criticamente, a questionar nossas cren√ßas e a buscar a sabedoria em nossa pr√≥pria exist√™ncia.",

Second of all, it is great that your personality is beginning to shine through more and more (as opposed to a boring, generic figure), and you have been more outgoing and showman-like, making the content increasingly entertaining. You keep elevating your identity through various &quot;journeys&quot; such as these and through mastering an entertaining and comedic character and your channel will soar past 50k soon. If you invest a bit more into the channel, create a set structure of uploads, and create some sort of continuity with your videos this will become a reality much sooner than expected.",
