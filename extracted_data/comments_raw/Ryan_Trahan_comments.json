We&#39;re not obligated to share how we&#39;re feeling but trust me, letting go and crying every once in a while can make you feel so much lighter. I think if we try as a collective to be less judgemental of people around us who cry (especially men), you&#39;ll find it easier to comfortably grieve or laugh or reminisce with tears. Watch a video of cute puppies, or soldiers coming home, or a sappy movie every now and then if you find it hard to let it out. Try and find time even if it&#39;s for 5 minutes to scream into a pillow or bawl your eyes outüòÇ, don&#39;t be too hard on yourself, you&#39;re loved. It&#39;s going to be ok. ‚ù§Ô∏è",

    "text": "When I went to prison on my first go around, they have a place called, &quot; the box&quot; which is basically the &quot;hole&quot; or solitaire confinement. It&#39;s horrible little messed up cell. The brick walls, no window, a big intimidating metal door, a metal framed bed bolted to the ground, a metal toilet with a sink on it. One light on the ceiling that stays on all day, all night. I was sent to the box the first time for a fight, that actually never really happened, with someone that I didn&#39;t even know, it&#39;s too long of a story but there I was in the cell next to his in the box and the only way to speak to each other was through a heating vent on the ground that ran through both of our cells. We would talk, because other than writing or reading that was the only thing to do. We talked for hours, for days, then weeks, we got pretty close without even ever seeing each other. <br>The box will do something to weird to your mind. The first few days are probably the worst. Time is slow, the light will give you a headache and you&#39;ll spend a lot of time just walking back and forth but something happens to a lot of people in there after awhile, time starts passing. You forget all about it and it just kinda speeds up without you noticing it, at this point of being in there, what the hell is time anyways? It doesn&#39;t matter. You&#39;ll forget what day it is. Then forget the date all together and sometimes when your up really late talking you&#39;ll go to bed late, or early depending on how long you talked and then there goes your normal sleeping cycle and if it wasn&#39;t for the kind of shit food your getting you wouldn&#39;t know if it was day or night and usually at this point you couldn&#39;t give less of a fuck. When I said that the box does weird shit to your head I meant that it really twists your shit up because before they we&#39;re going to put me back in general population I decided I was just going to refuse. I was going to stay in that little cell for as long as I could or until I paroled and that&#39;s what I did. I spent three years in that box. Obviously my neighbor left and over the next few years many came and left and I enjoyed talking to them, getting to know them, getting close to a human with just conversation knowing that I would most likely never see them again, that was a special feeling. I liked the books I read and I got really good at drawing. Increased my drawing skills up to portrait level using covers of books and the occasional magazine. <br>That cell changed me in more ways to count. Some good things and some not. Sorry for rambling it&#39;s just that this video reminded me of my little cell in the box.",

Some of the experiences shown here are traditionally triggered by psychedelic substances. When the mind has no input stimuli (no sight, sound and other things such as touch), it creates its own visuals based on the sum total of a person&#39;s lifetime experiences. The imagery seen can be metaphorical, with shapes, visuals and 3D &amp; 4D space &quot;representing different meaningful memories&quot;. This explanation is simplistic at best, but basically what is happening here. Well done on completing the challenge. It would be interesting to see your Dad go through the same experience, and see what comes out from his mental library.",

I had noise cancelling headphones on to protect my ears otherwise I would have suffered significant damage to my hearing. However, the physical trauma to my body was still significant. A church bell is shaped like the human rib cage and has multiple harmonics. This means that my rib cage was resonating in harmony with one of the bells and that was painful.",

I never fully understood it at the time, but the classes I heard those noises in...there was always at least one computer in the room.

Now I don&#39;t want to offend anyone cause I really don&#39;t know that much about autism or the background behind it but what little I do know poses an interesting question.

Let me explain:<br>The bleep or beep test is a multi-stage fitness test in which you must do 20 metre shuttle runs in time with the bleeps until the bleeps get too quick for you. It is a maximal test which means it will take you to your fitness limit. The shuttle runs are done in time to bleep sounds on a pre-recorded audio cassette.",

I was really sad but watching these videos reminds me that even if you‚Äôre behind many people, you can still push yourself to win. It‚Äôs honestly so inspiring how you just kept pushing yourself. If I was behind those two guys I would have surely stayed behind them, but after watching this video I remember that I can do something even when it seems impossible. So thank you @ryantrahan.",

    "text": "I love the analogy of the rooms. Each room is like a new stage in his life. The first room is fully decked out in Pok√©mon merchandise, representing his childhood. The second room is more simplistic, with the sheets of the bed having no design and only being an Earth color, and having sports and musical posters, all of which represent how he was in his high school/ college years.. The third room is, in my opinion, the most interesting room. The third room consists of a few plants, two motivational posters/signs, and 2 clocks, with a grey bed. But the reason I think it‚Äôs the most interesting room is that at the end it reveals that there was still a Bulbasaur Pok√©mon figurine, representing that portions of your childhood creep into your adult life. Another analogy I noticed was the clothes. At first Ryan was wearing very vibrant Pok√©mon gear, then in the second room he had a sort of base color relaxed/ athletic wear style. Then in the last room he‚Äôs wearing a long sleeve button up polo shirt and formal pants, even though he seems uncomfortable. At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hi0YBa4I6I&amp;t=1321\">22:01</a>, he say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm not growing as a person, but I also don‚Äôt want to look in the mirror and not recognize myself.‚Äù You can see has lost himself in trying to fit in with adults, he doesn‚Äôt recognize himself. I think that the end secret he keeps from us is that he can try and try and try to keep up with people his age, but both this experience and idea made him realize it‚Äôs okay to move at his own pace.<br><br>Sorry for the paragraph by the way",

Now you start to get older. You realize there is a time limit to this whole experience. You might not get what society tells you that you are to strive for, unless you do unsatisfactory things. Things that might change the &quot;you&quot; who wanted the life in the first place. You do it anyways. What is this life, unless you enjoy it after all? You, Ryan, as a person understand and empathize with the mindset of someone that has actually been in spots like this. <br><br>This is an absolute masterpiece of a video.

    "text": "I had a roommate I lived with in Denver years ago. She had this weird drunken play she&#39;d become kinda notorious for. She would often fall asleep drunk on the couch after going on wildly awkward DM binges directed via Instagram at pro skiiers/ boarders and random celebs she thought she could potentially meet someday. She always said something funny and flattering and would wake up the next AM and read them to us and we just would laugh at the nonsense.  Damn near all of them didn&#39;t answer her...but I shit you not- in the three years we lived there she probably got to meet like 4/5 famous athletes (mostly mountain sports) simply because she reached out and would offer to show them around Denver or let them stay with us or some other BS LOL One time Justin Bieber responded to her. Hahahaha he didn&#39;t ever meet her, but he answered and said she made him laugh LOL",

I have been watching your videos for so long and I genuinely think I may be one of your biggest fans. Your videos are  amazing and they just show how much time you spend on them through transitions and more. I watch your videos alot and they all cheer me up alot, and I know I&#39;m not alone when I say this. <br>I was very ill while watching this and somehow it actually helped alot. Thank you Ryan, please continue making these movie-like videos.",
