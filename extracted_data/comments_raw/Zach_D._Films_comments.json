I ended up super glueing the cut shut",

    "text": "I used to be a wood worker, and got a nasty oak splinter embedded in the palm of my right hand. It shattered under the skin and there were two large pieces left in my hand, and I was unable to reach them. I sat in my car after work trying in vain to dig them out with a sterile pin, but it was no use. A few days later I had a red welt the size of a plum on my hand, and it felt a burning pain constantly. I rubbed some polysporin on it, and when the swelling went down, I could see one of the pieces. I removed it, but the one ahead of it was still deep inside, and I was shaking with pain. A couple days later, the second piece worked it‚Äôs way to the surface, and I removed it. It took another week for my hand to heal up, and it left me with a weird round scar on my palm.",

And what else would happened if it was curved, hard and curved armor was way more than enough to stop arrows, and remember that short about plate carriers stopping bullets but still having pain? That‚Äôs kinda like plate armor, but it was designed to not make the user feel any, but blunt force only did that, and seeing arrows pierce through rounded objects hurts my brain.",

    "text": "Ex nurse here. Most shots are given into the muscle (intramuscular) or just under the skin (subcutaneous).  Areas are picked to avoid injecting into the vein, not the place shown in this video, such as the upper arm, or thigh.  If you need an injection into the vein (intravenous) a cannula is normally inserted and the medication injected into the cannula. The cannula can then be left in place for other iv injections. Or for a drip for example. However, if you need a blood test, access to a vein is needed. Veins are closer to the surface and can often be seen or felt so it is less likely to accidentally hit an artery. I‚Äôve never seen that happen in 30 years. If you don‚Äôt get the needle in correctly like this video shows, blood will leak into the tissues and cause a bruise.  That is what is being spoken about in this video. A bruise. Nothing to worry about.",

The needle goes in your shoulder, ass, or even stomach fat in some instances (at a steep angle, we ain&#39;t just shoving a needle into your guts, quarter inch at most). Medicines given via IM (intramuscular) injection go into muscles, not veins. The only scenario in which a vein can become infiltrated, or punctured through-and-through, is when inserting an IV into your arm or hand. It does hurt, but it&#39;s more of a mild burn and heals relatively quickly. It&#39;s essentially an internal bruise. Thanks for visiting my Ted Talk.",

    "text": "Another reason to not do this on purpose: it breaks the saw and depending on the type, the stopping mechanism, if you set it off. All saw stopping mechanisms like these have a high chance of damaging the saw blade. Some saw stopping mechanisms rely on an explosive charge that basically breaks the whole thing and drops the blade down into the table, and can only go off once, then you&#39;d have to open the whole thing up and fix everything and replace the charge if you want to get it back up and working with the saw stop. The kind in this video uses a block of aluminum and a spring, which is resettable, but not necessarily as reliable as the explosive charge one, due to the fact that it&#39;s relying on an aluminum block to stop a speeding saw, and doesn&#39;t drop the saw down into the table.",

These aren&#39;t a joke, I&#39;ve heard so many stories of blades exploding randomly or because the safety measures were activated. It stops the blade, but that blade is holding A LOT of energy. Stopping it is one thing, whether the blade remains whole is something else entirely.",

(New Braunfels) Gotta say, we were super impressed. I had to get a tumbler. The food and snacks were worth the stop. We recently drove to Baton Rouge and got to go to the one in Loxley, AL. Buc-ee‚Äôs is a fun stop, especially after driving for hours.",

They were extremely impressed and bought quite a few items that they had not seen anywhere else. Buc-Ees is amazing!  We have stopped at the one at Leeds, AL off I-20 numerous times and while traveling thru have stopped there with friends who had never heard of Buc-Eees.  They were all quite impressed. Over 120 gas pumps, huge spotlessly clean bathrooms.  There were about 16 men‚Äôs toilet rooms with full doors and at least that many sinks and urinals, lots of fresh food choices, decor items, souvenirs, name brand clothing, shoes and accessories, etc.   Prices are good as well.  The one in Leeds is across the street from a huge Bass Pro Shops and an outlet mall is across the interstate.",

    "text": "For Those Wondering:<br><br>Imagine lying back in a dentist‚Äôs chair, the drill whirring toward your mouth‚Äîand there‚Äôs no anesthesia. That was reality for dental patients before the mid-1800s. Tooth drilling without numbing agents was a brutal, painful experience. Dentists used hand-cranked drills or early foot-powered models that were slow, loud, and often heated up from friction‚Äîliterally burning your nerves as they ground away decay.<br><br>Patients were expected to grip the chair, scream, or even be physically restrained. There was no Novocaine, no laughing gas‚Äîjust grit, courage, and maybe a shot of whiskey. The pain was so intense that people often avoided dentists altogether, allowing infections and rot to spread, sometimes leading to deadly conditions like sepsis.<br><br>Fun Fact: The first successful use of anesthesia in dentistry was in 1846, using ether gas, which quickly changed everything. By the early 1900s, dental anesthesia became standard, finally making visits to the dentist a little less terrifying‚Äîand a lot less painful.",

I&#39;m not experienced at fishing at all, but when I got off work in the morning I would go out there and fish for gar, just because they were so fun to try and catch. I caught a few but of course I was never able to reel them in. I&#39;m sure I didn&#39;t have strong enough fishing line, and of course not enough experience. But I would get them close enough to maybe get them with a net, so I bought one of those, and I swear as long as I had that net by me I wouldn&#39;t catch a thing, as if they knew. <br><br>Then one day I caught a catfish, which I was able to easily reel in. But being inexperienced and a bit stupid it didn&#39;t occur to me that there wouldn&#39;t be enough oxygen in a small container of water. I put it in a small Styrofoam cooler until my husband came home because I didn&#39;t know how to clean fish, but the next time I checked on it it was dead.",

    "text": "This video is not entirely true.  As a former dairy maintenance professional I can tell you the dimples are for volume control.  The jugs are made by a process called blow molding, which can lead to an imprecise size due to many variable factors.  Those jugs are filled by volume, &quot;to full,&quot; so if the internal volume of the jug is off, the amount of milk sold will be wrong.  Those dimples are created by pucks screwed into the mold cavity, and so the volume can be adjusted on each batch of jugs by changing the size of pucks.",

    "text": "Milk jugs often have a dimple or indentation on one side near the bottom for a couple of reasons:<br><br>1. Structural Integrity: The dimple in milk jugs serves a structural purpose. It helps prevent the jug from collapsing or distorting when the milk is being poured. The dimple acts as a reinforcement, adding strength and stability to the jug, allowing it to withstand the pressure exerted by the liquid inside.<br><br>2. Improved Grip: The dimple also enhances the grip on the jug while pouring. It provides a natural thumb rest, allowing for better control and stability when handling and pouring milk. This feature helps prevent slippage and provides a more comfortable and secure grip for the user.<br><br>3. Controlled Flow: The dimple can help in achieving a smoother and controlled pour. It acts as a sort of spout or channel, guiding the milk flow and reducing the likelihood of spills or splashes.<br><br>It&#39;s important to note that not all milk jugs have a dimple, as different manufacturers may have different designs. However, the presence of a dimple is a common feature in many milk jugs and serves functional purposes as described above.",

    "text": "Dentist here. I&#39;ll clarify why some people say root canals hurt while others say it&#39;s practically pain free. More often then not it has to do with the state of the nerve in the tooth before having the procedure done. When exposed to bacteria, the nerve and blood supply will swell (just like anywhere else in the body). The swelling occurs in a tight enclosed hard structure (the tooth and the bone). The tissue wants to expand, but it can&#39;t so it builds a lot of pressure. <br><br>When you get numbed up, typically you&#39;re numbing certain types of nerve fibers. One of the last types of nerve fibers that can get numb are pressure sensing nerves. So, if the tooth has been experiencing a lot of pressure it is hard to get numb, and it hurts to do a root canal on it, even with a lot of anesthetic.<br><br>In addition, if there is an infection present, the infected tissue becomes pretty acidic. The local anesthetic has epinephrine in it, which is also acidic. The similar properties tend to repell each other. <br><br>Some ways to help reduce the pain would be to take an antibiotic beforehand to calm down the infection and reduce the inflammation. You can also split the root canal treatment into multiple appointments where the first appointment would be to directly access the center of the tooth and apply some medicine directly onto the pulp to allow it to become alleviated. Then you&#39;d seal up the tooth with a temporary filling, and set another appointment to finish the root canal treatment after the tooth has calmed down. <br><br>If the nerve has become necrotic, and is already dead, it no longer transmits any impulses. This is when a root canal can be nearly pain free. Sometimes a root canal is performed before the nerve gets too irritated, and it can be relatively easier to get numbed as well.",

    "text": "It&#39;s important to note that a can alone is unlikely to cause significant issues. However, there are a few scenarios in which debris like a can could potentially interfere with a car&#39;s brakes:<br><br>1. **Physical Obstruction**: If a can were to somehow get lodged in the brakes, such as between the brake rotor and brake caliper, it could prevent proper brake function. This might happen if the can is being compressed or crushed and ends up in a critical area of the braking system.<br><br>2. **Fluid Contamination**: If a can is damaged and leaks contents that could be corrosive or that might contaminate brake fluid, it could theoretically impair the brake system&#39;s function. However, this would require the can to be positioned in such a way that its contents could mix with the brake fluid.<br><br>3. **Puncturing Brake Lines**: If a can were to strike the brake lines or even some other critical component of the braking system while driving, it could potentially damage the braking systems, leading to brake failure.<br><br>4. **Driver Distraction**: In a more abstract sense, if a driver were to be distracted by a can in the roadway, it could potentially lead to an inability to stop in time or a collision.<br><br>In general, regular maintenance and checks by a professional can help ensure that a car&#39;s braking system remains functional and free of obstructions.",

    "text": "For those who didn‚Äôt understand:\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor is a fifth-generation, single-seat, twin-engine, all-weather stealth tactical fighter aircraft developed for the United States Air Force (USAF). The F-22 is considered one of the most advanced fighter jets in the world, boasting cutting-edge technology, exceptional maneuverability, and unparalleled stealth capabilities.\r<br>\r<br>Design and Development\r<br>\r<br>The F-22 program began in the 1980s as a response to the USAF&#39;s need for a next-generation air superiority fighter. Lockheed Martin (then Lockheed) was awarded the contract in 1991, and the first F-22 prototype made its maiden flight in 1997. The aircraft entered service in 2005.\r<br>\r<br>Components\r<br>\r<br>1. Airframe: The F-22&#39;s airframe is made of advanced composite materials, including carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) and titanium alloys. The airframe is designed to provide exceptional strength, durability, and stealth capabilities.\r<br>2. Engines: The F-22 is powered by two Pratt &amp; Whitney F119-PW-100 turbofan engines, each producing 35,000 pounds of thrust. The engines feature advanced compressor and turbine technology, providing exceptional power and efficiency.\r<br>3. Avionics: The F-22&#39;s avionics system is highly advanced, featuring a sophisticated radar system, advanced sensors, and a highly integrated computer system. The aircraft&#39;s avionics are designed to provide exceptional situational awareness, targeting capabilities, and communication systems.\r<br>4. Radar System: The F-22&#39;s radar system is the Northrop Grumman AN/APG-77 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar. This system provides exceptional range, resolution, and targeting capabilities, allowing the F-22 to detect and engage multiple targets simultaneously.\r<br>5. Stealth Capabilities: The F-22&#39;s stealth capabilities are designed to reduce its radar cross-section, making it difficult to detect and engage. The aircraft&#39;s stealth features include radar-absorbent materials, curved surfaces, and internal carriage of missiles and fuel.\r<br>\r<br>Capabilities\r<br>\r<br>1. Air-to-Air Combat: The F-22 is designed to excel in air-to-air combat, featuring exceptional maneuverability, advanced sensors, and highly integrated avionics.\r<br>2. Air-to-Ground Combat: The F-22 can carry a range of air-to-ground munitions, including precision-guided bombs and missiles.\r<br>3. Supercruise: The F-22 can maintain supersonic speeds without afterburners, providing exceptional range and endurance.\r<br>4. Advanced Sensors: The F-22&#39;s advanced sensors, including its AESA radar and advanced infrared sensors, provide exceptional situational awareness and targeting capabilities.\r<br>\r<br>Operational History\r<br>\r<br>The F-22 entered service in 2005 and has since been deployed in various combat and peacekeeping operations, including:\r<br>\r<br>1. Operation Iraqi Freedom\r<br>2. Operation Enduring Freedom\r<br>3. Operation Inherent Resolve\r<br>\r<br>Conclusion\r<br>\r<br>The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor is an exceptional fighter aircraft, boasting advanced technology, exceptional maneuverability, and unparalleled stealth capabilities. Its components, including its airframe, engines, avionics, and radar system, are highly advanced and provide exceptional performance. The F-22&#39;s capabilities, including air-to-air combat, air-to-ground combat, and supercruise, make it an invaluable asset to the USAF.",

Just got my ears checked recently, they said absolutely no wax build up and that my ears were clean. I think people may just not know what they‚Äôre doing<br><br><b>Edit:</b> Also, don‚Äôt be rough while doing it, you don‚Äôt want to scratch up your ears. Ear wax is a healthy thing at the end of the day. And when you push it in, don‚Äôt go too deep and then try to go around with it, because it will mess with your balance and make you a tad dizzy as soon as you do it. At least it does for me. I think it has something to do with those little crystals people have in their ears that are there to help with balance or something. But yeah, also my hearing is 100% if anyone was wondering about hearing. Honestly, it‚Äôs just ear wax at the end of the day. Be gentle with your ears, and wear headphones if you don‚Äôt like your earphones getting dirty so quickly",

    "text": "The correct way to use them (which I probably didn&#39;t learn until I was 40-something years old) is to run the Q Tip only around the outside edge of the ear canal, to catch the &quot;overflow&quot;, as it were. As a doctor explained to me &quot;your ears actually make wax for a reason - earwax protects your ear canal from bacteria. Left alone, the ears are &#39;self-cleaning&#39;, and you should only be cleaning the excess away&quot;. And if your sweetie objects, because he/she likes to put his/her tongue in your ears, just remind them that cats actually love ear wax. Don&#39;t believe me? Try putting your finger in your ear and getting a good amount of wax on your fingertip, then put it under your cat&#39;s nose - then just watch kitty go wild. My cat can hear the sound of my fingertip going into my ear from the other room - then she&#39;s right there in front of me, saying &quot;gimme&quot;. üòº Warning , if you make a habit of this, you may wake up to the indescribably weird sensation of a cat cleaning your ear for you (not that they can get their tongue any farther than a Q Tip should go, but...üò≥). I know that ear wax has mildly antiseptic qualities, however, that&#39;s just a bit too disgusting as far as I&#39;m concerned. Now I sleep with a hat on. ü§£",

The key is to assess the severity‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a simple or tension pneumothorax‚Äîand act swiftly to relieve the pressure, typically with needle decompression or a chest tube. Always monitor for signs of respiratory distress or hemodynamic instability, as timely intervention can prevent complications like hypoxia or cardiac arrest.",

My left lung developed micro tears from growing so quickly and would leak air into my chest cavity if I overexerted myself playing sports. One time my lung partially collapsed and I passed out. It was a &quot;spontaneous pneumothorax.&quot; I ended up having to go to the hospital with an ambulance and I had multiple surgeries over the course of 2 weeks. The lungs have an enormous amount of nerves so it is extremely painful to have surgical intervention on that area. Terrible experience. Supposedly it is quite rare. 1 in 10,000. And it usually happens in tall, skinny male teenagers.",

The toe is a memento of a story from the 1920s about a rum runner who lost a toe to frostbite and preserved it in alcohol.",
